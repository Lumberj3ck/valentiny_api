Can I make json key as a integer?

Set a unique key pair in db for name and user inside of section 
Because it is imposible for one user to have two the same sections


Create endpoint for getting user sections by user id 


Use integer keys as string on front

Realy hash passwords!


When user and sections just created then we need to either make second 
api call to fetch id of instance so then if user makes additional sections
changes we can send update api call


But we api after post can just send data without additional cal
